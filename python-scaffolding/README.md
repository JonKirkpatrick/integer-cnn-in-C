This section contains several artifacts related to the exploration of integer only learning.  Here we leverage the ease of PyTorch to handle tensors and the basic data flow, but intentionally sidestep autograd and any efficiencies that would require casting to float, even temporarily.  In this environment, we are able to quickly iterate as we try out new and unconventional techniques to manage the dynamics and variance of integer values as they traverse our CNN forward and back.
